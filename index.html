               <p>Using network cameras as multisensor, our algorithms are able to analyze the scenes 
                   to extract the informations that will be sent to our back-end in Cloud.</p>

               <h2>Distributed Computing On The Edge</h2>
                 <p>To drastically reduce bandwidth occupancy all elaborations are made on the AISee

                     to put AISee Box on the streets in a cabinet or in Network Operations Center.</p>


                 <h2>Privacy Protected</h2>
